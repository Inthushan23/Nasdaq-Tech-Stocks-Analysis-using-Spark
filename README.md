# Nasdaq Tech Stocks Insights with Spark

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a selection of Nasdaq tech stocks using the Apache Spark framework. The objective is to build a data-driven application to assist traders and investors in making smarter decisions based on stock trends and performance.

The project is structured into five main stages:
1. Project Initialization
2. Exploration
3. Pre-processing
4. Analysis and Visualization
5. Conclusion

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

### Notebook/
Contains the Jupyter notebooks used for the analysis:
- **Notebook_1.ipynb**:  
  Covers the project initialization, data download, exploratory analysis, and pre-processing steps.
- **Notebook_2.ipynb**:  
  Contains the data visualizations and interactive graphs to analyze the processed data.

You can run **Notebook_2** independently to directly explore the visualizations and final analysis without executing the data processing steps from **Notebook_1**.

### Project_Data/
Contains the data folders:
- **data_sources/**:  
  Includes raw data from Yahoo Finance.
- **data_cleaned/**:  
  Contains the cleaned and pre-processed data ready for analysis.

## Data Collection
Stock data is retrieved using the **yfinance** Python library. The selected companies for this analysis are:
- **Apple (AAPL)**
- **Nvidia (NVDA)**
- **Microsoft (MSFT)**
- **Amazon (AMZN)**
- **Google (GOOG)**

These companies were chosen for their leadership in their respective sectors, high market capitalizations, and innovative nature. They represent key players in electronics, software, cloud services, and e-commerce, and are seen as strong investment opportunities due to their long-term growth potential.
